### About Me

Since graduating from the University of Exeter in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering I have worked as a high school teacher and am currently training as a Java SDET consultant with Sparta Global. Prior to this I did a couple of years of freelance coding work in C# for the NHS constructing databases and spent many years working in the hospitality sector. I also hold Bronze, Silver and Gold Duke of Edinburgh Awards from my pre-University years.
